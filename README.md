Hi there! 

I'm Sandro and currently I study Web and Software Development in my free time using Udemy courses and working on personal projects.
Technology has always been my passion and I decided to make a career change, so the past 6 months have been all about it!
Most of my projects are built in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery but I'll soon start learning React and I'm also working on 2D games using Unity and C#.

If you're curious about knowing more about me feel free to visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandro-esposito-a35330102/">LinkedIn</a>.
